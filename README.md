# Hello! I’m Alexandra McKillip
**Data Scientist | Machine Learning Specialist | Industrial Engineer**

I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at Rice University, where I am specializing in Machine Learning. My academic journey is built on a rigorous foundation of statistics and core ML principles, which I am now extending into Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

My approach to Data Science is uniquely informed by my B.S. in Industrial Engineering (Minor in Statistics). This background gives me a unique "Systems Thinking" perspective, allowing me to treat data as part of a larger, interconnect process rather than just isolated numbers.

## Experience

#### Research Intern | Université de Poitiers, Poitiers, France
*(May 2023 – July 2023)*
* Researched core-shell nanoparticles using **C++** and **LAMMPS** simulations to determine material properties.
* Discovered that as the core radius of core-shell nanoparticles increases, their interface energy increases linearly.
* Authored a technical research paper and presented findings in professional settings.

#### Teaching Assistant, System Simulations | Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas
*(Jan. 2024 – May 2024)*
* Guided over 50 students during lab sessions for the stochastic simulation course, *System Simulations*.
* Provided individualized instruction by troubleshooting software (**Simio**) and simplifying complex topics.

## Key Projects

#### Predictive Analytics on Competitive Speedcubing
* **Goal:** Examine correlations and predict competitor performance across speedcubing events.
* **Techniques:** Conducted statistical analysis in **R** (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`,`softImpute` ) on World Cube Association data.
* **Models:** Applied **correlation analysis** and **matrix completion** with **principal component analysis**.

#### Optimizing Concrete Strength through Statistical and Predictive Modeling
* **Goal:** Identify key predictors of compressive strength in concrete mixtures.
* **Techniques:** Analyzed a dataset of 1,030 mixtures in **Python** (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`).
* **Models:** Utilized OLS, **LASSO**, Naive Bayes, and decision tree models.
* **Finding:** Found that higher cement and superplastic content and reduced water levels lead to stronger mixtures.

#### Safety Improvement Team for Engineering Composite Solutions (ECS)
* **Goal:** Enhance safety systems at ECS’s 100,000 sq ft manufacturing facility.
* **Analysis:** Analyzed incident reports and facility layout using **Python** and **Excel**.
* **Outcome:** Determined the optimal number, contents, and placement of emergency supply kits to ensure all employees could access them within OSHA-mandated response time.
