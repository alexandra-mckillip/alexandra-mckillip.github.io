## Experience

#### Research Intern | Université de Poitiers, Poitiers, France
*(May 2023 – July 2023)*
* Researched core-shell nanoparticles using **C++** and **LAMMPS** simulations to determine material properties.
* Discovered that as the core radius of core-shell nanoparticles increases, their interface energy increases linearly.
* Authored a technical research paper and presented findings in professional settings.

#### Teaching Assistant, System Simulations | Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas
*(Jan. 2024 – May 2024)*
* Guided over 50 students during lab sessions for the stochastic simulation course, *System Simulations*.
* Provided individualized instruction by troubleshooting software (**Simio**) and simplifying complex topics.

## Key Projects

#### Predictive Analytics on Competitive Speedcubing
* **Goal:** Examine correlations and predict competitor performance across speedcubing events.
* **Techniques:** Conducted statistical analysis in **R** (`lme4`, `ggplot2`) on World Cube Association data.
* **Models:** Applied **mixed-effects** and **ridge regression** models.

#### Optimizing Concrete Strength through Statistical and Predictive Modeling
* **Goal:** Identify key predictors of compressive strength in concrete mixtures.
* **Techniques:** Analyzed a dataset of 1,030 mixtures in **Python** (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`).
* **Models:** Utilized OLS, **LASSO**, Naive Bayes, and decision tree models.
* **Finding:** Found that higher cement and superplastic content and reduced water levels lead to stronger mixtures.

#### Safety Improvement Team for Engineering Composite Solutions (ECS)
* **Goal:** Enhance safety systems at ECS’s 100,000 sq ft manufacturing facility.
* **Analysis:** Analyzed incident reports and facility layout using **Python** and **Excel**.
* **Outcome:** Determined the optimal number, contents, and placement of emergency supply kits to ensure all employees could access them within OSHA-mandated response time.
